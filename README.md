# Fortran
This is a collection of my Fortran programs and modules. All are in more modern versions of Fortran. If you use my code, please cite me!

Most of the demos and modules are from a doctoral-level statistical computing course I taught for many years. I'll add other code from my research as I find and/or write it.

All of these are in modern dialects of Fortran; the oldest programs are in Fortran 90. 

I'll try to scan in older programs from my doctoral dissertation (in hybrid 77/90) as well as my Master's thesis (in FORTRAN 77). 

I wish I had my first such programs, written in WATFIV and on punch cards. What a hoot that would be!
